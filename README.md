# Experiment 4: Study of Set In Python

---

### Aim: Study Of Set In Python

---

### Algorithms

#### Algorithm for Problem Statement 1: Unique Event Participants

Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Create a list containing names of students, including duplicate entries.

Step 3: Convert the list into a set to remove duplicate names.

Step 4: Display the set containing only unique participant names.

Step 5: Stop.

#### Algorithm for Problem Statement 2: Common Elective Subjects

Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Create three sets representing elective subjects chosen by three students.

Step 3: Use the set intersection operation to find common subjects chosen by all students.(&)

Step 4: Display the common elective subjects.

Step 5: Stop.

#### Algorithm for Problem Statement 3: Students in Sports Clubs

Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Create one set containing students in the cricket club.

Step 3: Create another set containing students in the football club.

Step 4: Use the intersection operation to find students who are in both clubs.(&)

Step 5: Use the symmetric difference operation to find students who are in only one club.(^)

Step 6: Display both results.

Step 7: Stop.

---

#### Algorithm for Problem Statement 4: Absent Students

Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Create a set containing names of all students.

Step 3: Create another set containing names of present students.

Step 4: Use the difference operation to find absent students.(-)

Step 5: Display the absent students.

Step 6: Stop.

---

#### Algorithm for Problem Statement 5: Remove Invalid Course Codes

Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Create a set containing valid course codes.

Step 3: Remove the discontinued course code using the `remove()` or `discard()` method.

Step 4: Display the updated set of course codes.

Step 5: Stop.

### Theory

A **set** in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are defined using curly braces `{}`. Duplicate values are automatically removed, and elements cannot be accessed using indexing.

During this experiment, the following concepts were studied:

#### Properties and Methods:

* **Unordered Collection**: Elements in a set do not follow a fixed order.
* **Unique Elements**: Duplicate values are not allowed in a set.
* **Mutable Nature**: Sets can be modified using methods like `add()` and `remove()`.
* **Mixed Data Types**: Sets can store elements of different data types.
* **Set Operations**: Union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference are supported.
* **Frozen Set**: A frozen set is immutable and does not allow modification after creation.

#### Functions and Operations Used:

* **add()**: Adds an element to the set.
* **remove() / discard()**: Removes elements from the set.
* **Union (|)**: Combines elements of two sets.
* **Intersection (&)**: Finds common elements between sets.
* **Difference (-)**: Finds elements present in one set but not the other.
* **Symmetric Difference (^)**: Finds elements present in only one of the sets.
* **frozenset()**: Creates an immutable set.

### Conclusion

Through this experiment, the properties and applications of sets in Python were successfully studied. The experiment demonstrated that sets efficiently handle unique data and support powerful mathematical set operations. Sets are highly useful for tasks involving duplication removal, comparisons, and membership testing.
